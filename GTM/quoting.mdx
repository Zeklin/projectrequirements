## Overview
A price quote is a formal and detailed offer from a business to a prospect. It outlines the pricing details for work, including a breakdown of services and costs. Quotes inform customers about the exact cost of goods or services before they pay it. Customers may prefer to know the exact pricing in advance, so having a quote can increase the likelihood that the customer makes a purchase.

## Objective
The Quoting System of the Datum Business Cloud is designed to streamline the process of generating and managing quotes for transactions. This system provides customers with clear and detailed quotes that accurately reflect the products, services, and pricing offered.
