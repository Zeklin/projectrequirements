## Overview

Purchase orders will be the hub of procurement for Datum clients. They will be able to view past orders, and various metrics associated with their purchase history.

## Objective

This is the historical record for transactions between organizations and their suppliers. This is a major connecting point as the underlying data will be heavily integrated with other arms of the Datum platform.

## Context

## Assumptions

The purchase order window is a connector between the stakeholder platform and billing overview's transaction ledger. The user will select relevant information from the stakeholder database, or add a new vendor manually at that time. They will then input all necessary transactional data, which is then passed onto the billing platform's transaction ledger. 

Information in a purchase order object may include the following:
- Status
- Purchase date
- Purchase value
- Vendor/Supplier
- Transaction details - account used, payment method, attachments/aggrements
- Notes
