## Overview

Billing refers to the process of invoicing customers or clients for goods or services provided. It involves sending a bill or invoice that outlines the charges and payment terms. The purpose of billing is to request payment for the products or services rendered and to ensure timely payment from customers or clients.

## Objective

The billing overview platform is built to provide key insights into accounts recievable for Datum clients. At this time, it is not a holistic invoice processing platform. Instead, it will provide a snapshot of the client's fiscal situation for high level decision makers and investors. The first iteration of the Billing Overview platform will likely take shape as an integration with either the Stripe or Orb payment platform.

## Context

## Assumptions

There are three views that should makeup the Billing Overview: the overview itself, a spreadsheet of all invoices, and a two way transaction ledger. It should pull a standardized set of data (detailed below) from the connected invoicing platforms. The searchable spreadsheet should be populated with items that link out to the invoice platform for further details and information.
