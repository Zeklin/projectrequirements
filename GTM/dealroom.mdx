## Overview

The Deal Room functions as an interaction platform between a Datum client and one of their customers.

## Objective

Initially create a space for client-customer interactions. Following an agreement, transform into a reference point for customers to view tailored quotes, policies, and agreements.

## Context

## Assumptions

In its default state, the deal room needs to provide communication tools and quoting functionality to the client's customer. Ease of use is the highest priority, limiting any friction to incentivize a purchase.

The state following a deal is much more static, there should be 4 functions available to the customer.
- Start a new agreement - this is where a customer becomes a repeat customer
- View current quote / quote status - details the present state of an agreement
- View agreement(s) - details all past client-customer agreements
- View policies - details all relevant policies for present agreements
