## Overview
Metering and rating are integral components of billing systems, particularly in industries where services are consumed on a pay-per-use or usage-based model.
Metering involves the measurement and tracking of usage or consumption of a service, resource, or utility over a specific period. 
Metering systems typically capture data such as the quantity, duration, frequency, or volume of usage. Rating is the process of determining the charges or fees associated with the usage of a service based on predefined pricing structures, tariffs, or rate plans. It involves applying pricing rules and algorithms to the metered usage data to calculate the cost of the consumed services accurately.

## Objective
The Metering & Rating module within the Datum Business Cloud enables accurate measurement, tracking, and rating of usage-based services and resources. This document outlines the specific requirements for integrating with Metronome and Amberflo to enhance metering and rating capabilities within the platform.
This system provides seamless integration with Metronome and Amberflo platforms to capture usage data and events.
Enable dynamic pricing and rating based on usage metrics and customer-specific parameters.
Ensure accurate metering and billing for consumption-based services, enhancing transparency and customer satisfaction.
