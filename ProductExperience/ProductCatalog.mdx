- Scalability - The ability to to accommodate growth in data volume and user base over time 
- Customizability - Users have the ability to customize their product catalog based on their inventory and what information they want to display 
- Dynamic - Catalog is provisioned, scaled, and managed automatically in response to changing information in other modules  
## Requirements
