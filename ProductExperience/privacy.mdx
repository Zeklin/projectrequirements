## Overview
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European law that established protections for privacy and security of personal data about individuals in European Economic Area (“EEA”)-based operations and certain non-EEA organizations that process personal data of individuals in the EEA.
Subprocessor management is the process of selecting and managing third parties, or subprocessors, who handle data on behalf of a primary data processor. Subprocessors are a type of vendor who work within data processing agreements and are subject to the same data protection obligations as the data processor.
