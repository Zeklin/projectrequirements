## Overview
Entitlement refers to the rights or permissions granted to users or customers to access specific features, functionalities, or resources within the software. Entitlements define what a user is allowed to do or access based on factors such as their subscription plan, license agreement, or role within an organization.

## Objective
Entitlements determine which modules or features of the software a user can access based on their subscription tier. 
Users with higher-tier subscriptions have access to advanced features or larger usage quotas compared to users with lower-tier subscriptions.


Entitlement management involves defining and managing these rights or permissions, enforcing usage limits or quotas, and ensuring compliance with licensing agreements and subscription terms for software based products. 
This includes tasks such as configuring feature access permissions, monitoring usage metrics, and integrating entitlements with billing and subscription management systems.
