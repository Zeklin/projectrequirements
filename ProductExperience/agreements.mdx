## Overview
The agreement module is intended to simplify the process of creating, managing, and tracking agreement documents. 
It serves as a comprehensive solution for businesses to efficiently handle legal agreements with their customers, partners, and vendors.
## Objective
The Agreement Management System for the Datum Business Cloud project aims to develop a comprehensive platform for efficiently managing click-through and offline agreements, including Acceptable Use Policies (AUP) and Terms of Service. 
The agreement documents are meant to have both click through and offline management so documents can be electronically signed and edited but also be reviewed without internet access.
