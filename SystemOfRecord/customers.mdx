## Overview

Customers refer to organizations, enterprises, or individuals who utilize the services offered by Datum Business Cloud. These customers users who benefit from the functionalities provided by the platform, particularly in managing and enriching user, organization, and root organization data within their own systems or applications. Their information is organized into profiles to centralize information and provide insights to Datum clients.

## Objective

The customer management platform holds all relevant information for our client's customers. This should enable quicker dealflow and insights into the client's customer base.

## Context

## Assumptions

Customer profiles should be subdivided into Users, Accounts, and Parent Accounts. Users are the baseline of people who have interacted with our clients, nonpaying customers. Accounts encapsulate any user that also has an invoice or purchase history. Parent Accounts are the umbrella for multiple accounts under one entity. These profiles build upon each other, with expanding and more comprehensive features as the depth of the relationship is furthered.
