## Overview

## Objective
This operator portal is structured as a "single pane of glass" business view. 
This view provides centralized, enterprise-wide visibility into various sources of information and data to create a comprehensive, single source of truth in an organization.
The centralized platform should empower operators or administrators to efficiently manage and oversee various aspects of their enterprise products and services. 

This hosted amin panel helps users manage their websites and servers which can be viewed on the web hosting service's site.
Users are then able to handle tasks for servers and services hosted on the internet. 
Most of these handled tasks include business-related functions such as monitoring customer accounts, solving user problems, and processing their transactions.
