## Overview
The contact system is intended to facilitate the management of marketing contacts. 
Marketing contacts refer to individuals or entities that have expressed interest in or have engaged with a company's marketing efforts and fit a company's target audience.
These contacts can consist of prospective customers or businesses, current customers or businesses, subscribers, and/or partners such as other businesses which the company collaborates with.

## Objective
The contact system should manage and organize the marketing contacts which can be segmented based on various factors such as demographic, behavior, engagement level, etc. 
The main intent of the contact system is to use the users information (that they are willingly providing) in order to add them to the company's opt-in list. 
These opt-in lists mean that the users agree to receive mass emails, newsletters, or other forms of digital communication from the company.
Dynamic lists are utlizied for the contact system because the size of the lists are modifiable. 
Additonally, an opt-in feature is implemented so that users are willingly adding themselves to these marketing contact lists.
## Context
   
## Assumptions
When a user is added to the contact system and onto these dynamic lists it is important that enough information is provided about the user. Specifically, the following fields are critical to the contact system:
- Subscriber - The contact information of the subscriber 
- Group - The group (aka organization, team, account) that the actor is a member of (needed to show admins the full history of their group).
- Information - Information about the user that should be shown in the contact list
- Scalability - The ability to to accommodate growth in data volume and user base over time 
- CRM - Implement customer relationship management practices and strategies
